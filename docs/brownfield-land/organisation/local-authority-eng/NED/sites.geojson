Since planning permission was granted on site, the Government has confirmed proposals for the realignment of the proposed route for HS2, such that it runs through the eastern end of the Coalite site affecting residential development. The impact of this creates significant uncertainty for the approved scheme and the council cannot be confident that the housing development will come forward.
