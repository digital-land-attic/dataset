The Howard Venue is a valued asset well used by the local community and should be retained on the site.

The historic avenue of trees along the western boundary of the site provides an opportunity to create well defined built frontage facing onto landscape rather than the backs of buildings. Be fully integrated into the existing urban fabric by responding to the village character of Hextable in terms of scale, materials and layout. Use the existing perimeter block street pattern to the east of the site on Egerton Avenue and New Road to inform the layout of housing on site. Establish a network of connected streets which prioritise walking and cycling over private car use for short trips within the development. The structure of the site should naturally extend the existing grain of streets. The development of the site provides a good opportunity to introduce a new pedestrian link from the elbow of Egerton Avenue towards the south and west to connect into the top of Swanley Park. Create safe, attractive and clear cycling and pedestrian routes which minimise distances between the site and local shops, services and public transport interchanges.

Any additional development proposed will be required to be of high quality design and careful layout, provide a buffer to protect the ancient woodland, and protect priority habitats.

Respect and respond sensitively to the existing features within the site that are positive and that make the site unique. Fort Halstead, a designated Scheduled Monument and of historic military significance, should be protected, enhanced and better presented in any development proposal.

Retain and integrate the historic building sensitively into the site. Retain or re-provide existing office floorspace as part of a mixed use scheme. Homes should front streets and some green spaces to provide sociable and safe neighbourhoods. The possibility of homes facing outwards onto Knights Croft and the footpath that runs along the west of the site should be explored to integrate the site into the neighbourhoods on either side and improve the quality of the environment along these routes. Establish a network of connected streets which prioritise walking and cycling over private car use for short trips within the development. Proposals should especially consider safe and clear pedestrian and cycle routes to New Ash Green village centre. This might require improvement to the existing route that connects the shops with North Ash Road via Over Minnis. Principal vehicle access to the site will be from North Ash Road. Use the natural features of the site to inform development and integrate it into its wider setting. The trees can be used to reinforce local distinctiveness. Proposals should respect the values of the original New Ash Green masterplan by incorporating communal landscaped spaces with planting and trees into development proposals.", "organisation": "local-authority-eng:SEV", "ownership-status": "not owned by a public authority", "planning-permission-date": null, "planning-permission-history": null, "planning-permission-status": "not permissioned", "planning-permission-type": null, "point": "POINT(0.305315 51.363788)", "site": "BFR122", "site-plan-url": "https://maps.sevenoaks.gov.uk/brownfield_register/", "start-date": null, "slug": "/brownfield-land/local-authority-eng/SEV/BFR122"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.305315, 51.363788]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"resource": "9d7d79526f136c59033c5f53be97ea58169fb3d9f232cd81989bcd83fe845e1e", "name": "BFR118", "site-address": "White Oak Leisure Centre, Hilda May Avenue, Swanley", "deliverable": "yes", "end-date": null, "entry-date": "2020-04-30", "hazardous-substances": null, "hectares": 2.011165, "maximum-net-dwellings": 80.0, "minimum-net-dwellings": 80.0, "notes": "Emerging Local Plan Ref ST2-20 - Any development scheme must include replacement leisure facilities as part of a mixed use scheme.

Respect and respond sensitively to the existing features within the site that are positive and that make the site unique. Fort Halstead, a designated Scheduled Monument and of historic military significance, should be protected, enhanced and better presented in any development proposal. Improve the provision and connectivity of green infrastructure including improvements to the Public Right of Way network. Multiple access points will be required to serve the development.

This should be of an equivalent scale and skill level to that when the site was fully operational to ensure the District\u2019s economy remains dynamic.

Any additional development proposed will be required to be of high quality design and careful layout, provide a buffer to protect the ancient woodland, and protect priority habitats.

Fort Halstead, a designated Scheduled Monument and of historic military significance, should be protected, enhanced and better presented in any development proposal.

Ensure a hierarchy of routes so that important routes are clearly identifiable. Use the natural features of the site to inform development and integrate it into its wider setting. The topography, geology and trees can be used to reinforce local distinctiveness. In particular, the existing avenue of trees along the western edge of the site should help to provide a strong characteristic for the site.", "organisation": "local-authority-eng:SEV", "ownership-status": "owned by a public authority", "planning-permission-date": null, "planning-permission-history": null, "planning-permission-status": "not permissioned", "planning-permission-type": null, "point": "POINT(0.155817 51.405454)", "site": "BFR64", "site-plan-url": "https://maps.sevenoaks.gov.uk/brownfield_register/", "start-date": "2017-11-01", "slug": "/brownfield-land/local-authority-eng/SEV/BFR64"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.155817, 51.405454]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"resource": "c84876116a22210cb82eb5144dea2f94913745a11a6bd0a06e6f4ecbc15f643f", "name": "BFR71", "site-address": "Former Birchwood Primary School, Russett Way, Swanley", "deliverable": "yes", "end-date": null, "entry-date": "2019-12-18", "hazardous-substances": null, "hectares": 0.66, "maximum-net-dwellings": 39.0, "minimum-net-dwellings": 39.0, "notes": "Emerging Local Plan Ref ST2-22 -

This might require improvement to the existing route that connects the shops with North Ash Road via Over Minnis. Principal vehicle access to the site will be from North Ash Road.

Respect and respond sensitively to the existing features within the site that are positive and that make the site unique. Fort Halstead, a designated Scheduled Monument and of historic military significance, should be protected, enhanced and better presented in any development proposal. Improve the provision and connectivity of green infrastructure including improvements to the Public Right of Way network. Multiple access points will be required to serve the development.
