The site is at high risk and is poorly defended from tidal flooding and would be subject to Sequential Test and Exception Test. The Environment Agency (EA) has also indicated the site will also be dependent on the Eastern Wall flood defence coming forward (programmed 2020/22). The site lies on Tidal Flat Deposits underlying Hastings Beds. Tidal Flats Deposits are classed as unproductive strata and the Hastings Beds are classed as a Secondary A aquifer. The EA advises a proposal would have to undertake a land contamination assessment with the planning application that demonstrated any unacceptable risks could be managed appropriately through the re-development process. The EA has also advised that how foul water is disposed to ground in the area is important due to the shallow groundwater and very limited attenuation that would occur in the unsaturated zone above the water table.

If required, the current users of the Drill Hall have been provided for at an alternative location. Development of the site should be through a comprehensive masterplan and should focus on an accessible, sustainable and high quality leisure hub facility, creating a landmark leisure destination through high quality buildings and public realm on this highly prominent gateway site into the town.
