Highway access should be provided from Wartling Drive and Principal Close, via Coneyburrow Lane, alongside offsite highway works to make the development acceptable in highway terms. In accordance with policy DEN5 \u2018Sustainable Drainage\u2019 at least two forms of appropriate SuDS should be incorporated and an appropriate assessment under the Habitat Regulations demonstrates beyond reasonable scientific doubt that these can be delivered on the site and that the development can otherwise proceed, with mitigation if necessary, without harming the integrity of the adjacent Pevensey Levels Special Area of Conservation/Ramsar site. Flood zone 3 should be kept free from development. Suitable provision should be made for children\u2019s play space in the form of both a Locally Equipped Area for Play (LEAP) and a Local Area for Play (LAP). The Public Right of Way (PROW) should be reinstated through the middle of the site, following the stream corridor together with a financial contribution towards improvements to the existing PROW network in the locality. A travel plan is included to promote the use of alternative travel choices other than the private car, including off-site measures to support cycling and walking and other sustainable transport modes to encourage the use of public transport, car sharing and electric, low and ultra-low emission vehicles in compliance with Core Strategy Policy TR3. Improvements should also be made to existing local bus stop infrastructure and a financial contribution towards improving local bus services is provided. Provision should be made for the retention and enhancement of existing landscape buffers with locally characteristic native tree and shrub planting, particularly on the western and northern boundaries. A connection should be provided to the local sewerage system at the nearest point of adequate capacity, in collaboration with the service provider. Development of the site should be through a Green Infrastructure framework and landscape led masterplan.
