This planning history goes back over a long period. An initial permission for redevelopment of the bus station site, providing retail units and 30 flats, was granted in 1992 (T/92/E/398,T/950511). Despite renewal, this lapsed. A number of years later a revised scheme was submitted for tandem redevelopment of both parcels.

The site encompasses two parcels of land (2497, 2258) and encompasses an operating bus station, photography studio, a former ropery, various vacant buildings, as well as areas of vacant land.
