Proposals for mixed-use redevelopment have been made on a number of occasions over the years, in part and as part of a wider scheme with adjacent land (2258, 2497). This planning history goes back over a long period. An initial permission for redevelopment of the bus station site, providing retail units and 30 flats, was granted in 1992 (T/92/E/398,T/950511). Despite renewal, this lapsed. A number of years later a revised scheme was submitted for tandem redevelopment of both parcels. A revised application for a complex mixed-use scheme of residential development and retail, commercial and office floorspace was permitted but again lapsed without commencement (15/02794/FUL). A total of 36 dwellings were proposed, comprising of 5 houses and 31 apartments in three blocks. The proposal included part demolition, reconstruction, alteration and conversion of the existing buildings. It has recently been confirmed that a revised scheme is going to be proposed in due course.

There will be opportunity for a higher density development in this location, probably with an apartment scheme. The potential yield is recorded against the former bus station record (see 2497). An application for extensive and complex redevelopment works, including part demolition, reconstruction, alteration and conversion of a range of buildings to create a mixed-use development, including to create 36 dwellings and commercial floorspace, was permitted in 2015 (15/02794/FUL)..The proposed scheme would deliver floorspace for retail, commercial and office premises, alongside the development of 5 houses and 31 flats across three apartment blocks. The site encompasses two parcels of land (2497, 2258) and encompasses an operating bus station, photography studio, a former ropery, various vacant buildings, as well as areas of vacant land. This permission lapsed due to non-implementation. Another application for demolition of the ropery and construction of 6 dwellings was withdrawn prior to determination (13/03838/FUL). This scheme only encompassed the old ropery building on the eastern parcel (2258), An earlier application for demolition of the existing building and construction of 17 apartments and 2 office units, was permitted in 2006 (T/20061115). This scheme was for the bulk of the eastern parcel, but excluding the old ropery (2258), Similarly, this permission lapsed due to non-implementation. An earlier outline application for part clearance and construction of retail units and 30 flats was permitted in 2005 (T/950511). This was a renewal of an earlier permission, dating from 1992 (T/92/E/398). A revised application for a complex mixed-use scheme of residential development and retail, commercial and office floorspace was permitted but again lapsed without commencement (15/02794/FUL). A total of 36 dwellings were proposed, comprising of 5 houses and 31 apartments in three blocks.
